MapReduce is the data processing layer of Hadoop (other layers are HDFS – data processing layer, Yarn – resource management layer). 
MapReduce is a programming paradigm designed for processing huge volumes of data in parallel by dividing the job (submitted work) into a set of independent tasks (sub-job). 
You just need to put the custom code (business logic) in the way map reduce works and rest things will be taken care by the engine.
